# Observability Fundamentals

## Introduction to Observability

Observability is the ability to understand the internal state of a system based solely on its external outputs. Unlike traditional monitoring, which focuses on known failure modes, observability allows engineers to ask new questions about system behavior and investigate issues they didn't predict in advance.

The concept originates from control theory, where a system is considered "observable" if its current state can be determined from its outputs. In software engineering, this translates to having enough telemetry data from your systems to understand what's happening inside without having to deploy new code to get more information.

## The Three Pillars of Observability

### 1. Metrics

**Definition**: Numerical representations of data measured over time intervals.

**Characteristics**:

- Low cardinality, high volume
- Aggregated by nature (counters, gauges, histograms)
- Lightweight and efficient to store
- Useful for long-term trends and patterns

**Key Concepts**:

- **Counter**: Cumulative metric that only increases (e.g., request count)
- **Gauge**: Metric that can increase or decrease (e.g., memory usage)
- **Histogram**: Measurement distributions (e.g., response time distributions)
- **Cardinality**: Number of unique series in a metric
- **Resolution**: Frequency of data points collection

**Best Practices**:

- Choose metrics that directly reflect user experience
- Keep cardinality under control
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Focus on business-relevant metrics alongside technical ones
- Establish baselines for normal behavior

### 2. Logs

**Definition**: Time-stamped records of discrete events that occurred in the system.

**Characteristics**:

- High volume, potentially high cardinality
- Rich in context but expensive to store and process
- Sequential and typically unstructured or semi-structured
- Provide detailed information about specific events

**Types of Logs**:

- **Application logs**: Generated by application code
- **System logs**: Generated by operating systems
- **Access logs**: Record of requests to services
- **Audit logs**: Record of user actions for compliance

**Best Practices**:

- Use structured logging (JSON/key-value pairs)
- Include contextual information (request ID, user ID)
- Implement appropriate log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- Consider sampling strategies for high-volume logs
- Establish retention policies based on utility and compliance

### 3. Traces

**Definition**: Records of requests as they flow through distributed systems, tracking the entire journey across services.

**Characteristics**:

- Connect related events across distributed systems
- Show causal relationships between services
- Provide timing information for each segment
- Relatively low volume but high cardinality

**Key Concepts**:

- **Span**: Represents a unit of work in a trace
- **Trace ID**: Unique identifier for a request flow
- **Parent-child relationships**: How spans relate to each other
- **Span attributes**: Metadata about the operation
- **Span events**: Time-stamped events within a span

**Best Practices**:

- Propagate context between services
- Add business-relevant attributes to spans
- Focus on critical paths through your system
- Sample traces strategically to manage costs
- Correlate traces with logs and metrics

## Monitoring vs. Observability

### Monitoring

- **Focus**: Known failures and conditions
- **Approach**: Alert-driven, threshold-based
- **Questions**: "Is the system working?"
- **Workflow**: Define metrics → Set thresholds → Alert when crossed
- **Tools**: Predominantly metrics-based dashboards
- **Perspective**: System-centric

### Observability

- **Focus**: Unknown failures and conditions
- **Approach**: Query-driven, exploratory
- **Questions**: "Why is the system not working as expected?"
- **Workflow**: Collect telemetry → Explore data → Form and test hypotheses
- **Tools**: Integrated metrics, logs, and traces with query capabilities
- **Perspective**: User-centric

**Key Differences**:

- Monitoring tells you **when** something is wrong
- Observability helps you figure out **why** something is wrong
- Monitoring is a subset of observability
- Observability requires higher cardinality data
- Monitoring focuses on predefined questions; observability enables asking new questions

## Observability-Driven Development Practices

### Core Principles

1. **Design for observability from the start**
2. **Consider observability as a feature, not an add-on**
3. **Test observability alongside functionality**
4. **Make systems understandable, not just available**

### Implementation Strategies

- **Establish telemetry requirements** during design phase
- **Define "done" to include** proper instrumentation
- **Create observability test plans** alongside functional test plans
- **Add context propagation** in early architectural decisions
- **Build health endpoints** that expose internal state

### Development Lifecycle Integration

1. **Design phase**: Identify key events, metrics, and flows to instrument
2. **Implementation**: Add instrumentation as features are developed
3. **Testing**: Verify observability data is accurate and useful
4. **Deployment**: Include observability verification in deployment checks
5. **Operations**: Continuously improve based on operational findings

### Benefits

- Earlier detection of issues
- Faster mean time to resolution (MTTR)
- Better understanding of system behavior
- More confidence in changes
- Improved developer experience

## Instrumentation Strategies for Applications

### Manual Instrumentation

- **Definition**: Developer explicitly adds code to emit telemetry data
- **Pros**: Precise control, domain-specific context
- **Cons**: Higher development overhead, potential inconsistency
- **Best for**: Business-critical paths, domain-specific events

### Automatic Instrumentation

- **Definition**: Libraries or agents that add instrumentation without code changes
- **Pros**: Low effort, consistent coverage
- **Cons**: Less contextual data, potential performance impact
- **Best for**: Standard protocols (HTTP, gRPC), databases, frameworks

### Instrumentation Approaches

1. **Code-level**: Direct API calls in application code
2. **Agent-based**: Separate process or sidecar collecting data
3. **Library-based**: Instrumentation embedded in libraries you use
4. **Service mesh**: Infrastructure layer handling telemetry

### Key Areas to Instrument

- **Service boundaries**: Incoming and outgoing requests
- **Dependencies**: Database queries, cache operations, external API calls
- **Critical paths**: User-facing transactions and core business logic
- **Resource usage**: CPU, memory, disk I/O, network
- **Business events**: User actions, state transitions, business outcomes

### Best Practices

- Use standardized instrumentation libraries (OpenTelemetry)
- Add business context to technical telemetry
- Instrument both happy and error paths
- Consider sampling strategies for high-volume data
- Maintain consistent attribute naming across services

## Service Level Indicators, Objectives, and Agreements

### Service Level Indicator (SLI)

- **Definition**: Quantitative measure of service level
- **Examples**:

  - Availability (% of successful requests)
  - Latency (90th percentile response time)
  - Throughput (requests per second)
  - Error rate (% of failed requests)
  - Data freshness (time since last update)

- **Characteristics of good SLIs**:
  - Directly tied to user experience
  - Measurable and quantifiable
  - Simple to understand
  - Actionable when degraded

### Service Level Objective (SLO)

- **Definition**: Target value or range for an SLI over a specified period
- **Examples**:

  - 99.9% availability measured over 30 days
  - 95% of requests complete in under 200ms
  - Error rate below 0.1% measured over 7 days

- **Components**:

  - SLI specification
  - Target value or threshold
  - Measurement window (7 days, 30 days, etc.)
  - Error budget (100% - SLO target)

- **Error Budgets**:
  - Acceptable amount of service degradation
  - When depleted: focus on reliability over features
  - When surplus exists: opportunity to take more risk

### Service Level Agreement (SLA)

- **Definition**: Contractual obligation for service performance
- **Relationship to SLOs**: SLAs should be less stringent than internal SLOs
- **Components**:
  - Service level commitments
  - Measurement methodology
  - Exclusions and limitations
  - Remediation or penalties for violations

### Implementation Process

1. **Identify critical user journeys**
2. **Define SLIs that represent user experience**
3. **Set realistic SLO targets based on business needs**
4. **Establish measurement and reporting mechanisms**
5. **Create alerting based on SLO burn rate**
6. **Review and refine regularly based on experience**

## Correlation of Telemetry Data Across Distributed Systems
