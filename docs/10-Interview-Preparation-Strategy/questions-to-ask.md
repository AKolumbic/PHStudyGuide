# Questions to Ask: Chatbot Project and Technical Operations

This guide provides thoughtful questions to ask during your interview about the chatbot project, team structure, observability, technical stack, and incident management. Each section includes strategic questions designed to demonstrate your technical depth and leadership while gathering crucial information about the role.

## 1. The Chatbot Project and Physical Store Integration

Understanding the chatbot project and its integration with physical stores shows your interest in the business context and technical challenges specific to this implementation.

### Strategic Questions

- "Could you walk me through the customer journey and how the chatbot fits into the overall experience between digital and physical touchpoints?"
- "What are the key success metrics for the chatbot project, both from a technical perspective and a business outcomes perspective?"
- "How does the chatbot handle the transition between digital interaction and in-store experiences? Are there particular integration challenges you've encountered?"
- "What types of data flow between the chatbot system and the physical store systems, and how do you manage that data exchange?"
- "How are you addressing the challenge of maintaining context when a customer moves from chatbot interaction to speaking with an in-store associate?"

### Why These Questions Matter

These questions show you're thinking about the full ecosystem of the product rather than just isolated technical components. They demonstrate your understanding that successful technical implementations must solve real business problems and create seamless customer experiences.

## 2. Team Structure and Collaboration Models

Understanding the team dynamics helps you assess cultural fit and identify potential challenges in delivering projects effectively.

### Strategic Questions

- "How is the team structured around the chatbot project? Are there dedicated roles for different aspects like NLP, integration, and analytics?"
- "What does collaboration look like between the engineering team and other departments like retail operations, customer service, and data science?"
- "How do you balance autonomy and alignment across teams working on interconnected components of the system?"
- "What communication practices have you found most effective for keeping everyone informed about project status and technical decisions?"
- "How does the team approach knowledge sharing and skill development, particularly around emerging technologies in the conversational AI space?"

### Why These Questions Matter

These questions demonstrate your understanding that technical success depends on effective team structures and collaboration patterns. They show you're thinking about how to work effectively within the organization rather than just focusing on code.

## 3. Current Observability Challenges and Solutions

Asking about observability shows your focus on system reliability and your experience dealing with complex distributed systems.

### Strategic Questions

- "What are the most challenging aspects of monitoring the chatbot's performance and reliability, especially as it interacts with physical store systems?"
- "How do you currently track and measure the quality of conversational experiences from both technical and user satisfaction perspectives?"
- "What observability tools and practices have you implemented across your distributed system components? Are there any gaps you're looking to address?"
- "How do you distinguish between issues in the NLP components versus integration points with other systems when troubleshooting problems?"
- "What kind of feedback loops exist between observability data and improvements to the chatbot's conversation models or business logic?"

### Why These Questions Matter

These questions demonstrate your understanding that modern systems require sophisticated observability approaches. They show you're thinking about how to maintain reliability and quality in a complex, distributed architecture with both technical and user experience dimensions.

## 4. Technical Stack Details and Decision-Making Process

Understanding the technical stack and how decisions are made reveals the engineering culture and helps you assess technical compatibility.

### Strategic Questions

- "Could you describe the current technical architecture of the chatbot system and its integration points with other systems?"
- "What frameworks or platforms are you using for natural language processing and conversation management? What influenced those choices?"
- "How do you approach make-versus-buy decisions for components of your system? For example, between using third-party NLP services versus building custom models?"
- "What has been your experience with the current technical stack in terms of scalability and flexibility as the project has evolved?"
- "How does your team evaluate and incorporate new technologies or approaches? Is there a formal process for technical decision-making?"

### Why These Questions Matter

These questions demonstrate your technical depth and understanding of architectural considerations. They show you're thinking about the trade-offs inherent in technical decisions and how those decisions impact the system's evolution over time.

## 5. On-Call Responsibilities and Incident Management Practices

Understanding incident management practices helps you assess work-life balance and the maturity of the engineering organization.

### Strategic Questions

- "How is on-call responsibility structured for the chatbot system? What's the rotation like and what's the typical frequency of incidents?"
- "Could you walk me through how a typical incident is detected, communicated, and resolved, particularly when it involves both the chatbot and physical store systems?"
- "What tools and processes do you have in place for incident response and post-incident analysis?"
- "How do you balance the need for rapid incident resolution with the importance of understanding root causes?"
- "What have been some of the most challenging incidents you've faced with the chatbot system, and how did those experiences shape your current practices?"

### Why These Questions Matter

These questions demonstrate your understanding of operational excellence and your experience with maintaining production systems. They show you're thinking about how to build reliable systems and continuously improve based on operational experiences.

## Building Your Own Questions

When preparing for your interview, consider customizing these questions based on:

1. **Your specific interests and strengths**: Emphasize areas where you can showcase your expertise.

2. **The company's industry and customers**: Tailor questions to reflect the specific business context.

3. **Information from preliminary research**: Reference public information about the company's technical approaches or challenges.

4. **Earlier interview discussions**: Build on information shared in previous conversations.

When asking these questions during the interview, listen actively to the responses and ask thoughtful follow-up questions that demonstrate your engagement and understanding. The goal is to have a meaningful conversation that helps both you and the interviewer assess mutual fit while showcasing your technical depth and leadership.

Remember that good questions often reveal as much about your thinking and approach as your answers to their questions. By asking insightful questions about the chatbot project, team structure, observability, technical stack, and incident management, you demonstrate your holistic understanding of what makes technical projects successful.
